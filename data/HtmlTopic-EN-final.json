There is currently no reliable evidence on screening for trans men and people on the transmasculine spectrum patients who have had a mastectomy; consider discussing the unknown risks associated with residual breast tissue, as well as the possible technical limitations of mammography (UCSF). Consider continuing regular monitoring for breast cancer even after mastectomy, as mastectomies usually do not remove breast tissue in its entirety; the Endocrine Society suggests conducting sub- and periareolar annual breast examinations if the patient has undergone a mastectomy, whereas UCSF cautions against it (not evidence-based).",
